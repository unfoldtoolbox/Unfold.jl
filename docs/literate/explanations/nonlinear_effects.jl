# What we can clearly see here, that the linear effect (blue) underfits the data, the `spl(x,10)` overfits it, but the `spl(x,4)` fits it perfectly.


# ## Looking under the hood
# Let's have a brief look how the splines manage what they are managing. 
#
# The most important bit to understand is, that we are replacing `x` by a set of coefficients `spl(x)`.
# These new coefficients each tile the range of `x` (in our case from [0-1]) in overlapping areas, each which will be fit by one coefficient.
# Because the ranges are overlapping, we get a smooth function.
#
# Maybe this becomes clear after looking at such a basisfunction:

term_spl = Unfold.formulas(uf_spl10)[1].rhs.terms[2]

# This is the spline term.
typeof(term_spl)

# a special type generated in Unfold.jl
#
# it has a field .fun which is the spline function. We can evaluate it at a point
const splFunction = Base.get_extension(Unfold, :UnfoldBSplineKitExt).splFunction
splFunction([0.2], term_spl)

# each column of this 1 row matrix is a coefficient for our regression model.
lines(disallowmissing(splFunction([0.2], term_spl))[1, :])

# Note: We have to use disallowmissing, because our splines return a `missing` whenever we ask it to return a value outside it's defined range, e.g.:
splFunction([-0.2], term_spl)

# because it never has seen any data outside and can't extrapolate!

# Okay back to our main issue: Let's plot the whole basis set
basisSet = splFunction(0.0:0.01:1, term_spl)
basisSet = disallowmissing(basisSet[.!any(ismissing.(basisSet), dims = 2)[:, 1], :]) # remove missings
ax = Axis(Figure()[1, 1])
[lines!(ax, basisSet[:, k]) for k = 1:size(basisSet, 2)]
current_figure()

# notice how we flipped the plot around, i.e. now on the x-axis we do not plot the coefficients, but the `x`-values
# Now each line is one basis-function of the spline. 
#
# Unfold returns us one coefficient per basis-function
β = coef(uf_spl10)[1, 1, :]
β = Float64.(disallowmissing(β))

# but because we used an intercept, we have to do some remodelling in the basisSet
X = hcat(ones(size(basisSet, 1)), basisSet[:, 1:5], basisSet[:, 7:end])

# now we can weight the spline by the basisfunction
weighted = (β .* X')

# Plotting them makes for a nice looking plot!
ax = Axis(Figure()[1, 1])
[lines!(weighted[k, :]) for k = 1:10]
current_figure()


# and sum them up 
lines(sum(weighted, dims = 1)[1, :])
plot!(X * β, color = "gray") #(same as matrixproduct X*β directly!)
current_figure()

# And this is how you can think about splines
