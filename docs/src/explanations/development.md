## Install a dev-version of Unfold
In order to see and change the tutorials, you have to install a local dev-version of Unfold via:

`]dev --local Unfold` 

This clones the `git#main` into `./dev/Unfold`

### Instantiating the documentation environment
To generate documentation, we recommend to install LiveServer.jl - then you can do:
```julia
using LiveServer
servedocs(skip_dirs=joinpath("docs","src","generated"),literate_dir=joinpath("docs","literate"))
```

If you prefer a one-off:
- activate the  `./docs` folder (be sure to `]instantiate` the first time!)
- run `include("docs/make.jl")`
